// Worker pool sizing for the vitest fork pool.
//
// Vitest 4 defaults to `pool: 'forks'` and sizes the pool from
// `os.availableParallelism()`. On a 16-core host that means up to ~16
// concurrent forks, each loading jsdom + the full app graph. Under that
// load the pool has been observed to over-spawn and surface as a
// "mass-failure" run ("51 failed | 14 passed") even though every spec
// passes when run in isolation. The symptom is worker spawn / IPC
// timeout under resource pressure, not a per-spec leak — `installLocalStorageStub`
// re-installs `window.localStorage` per test with `configurable: true`,
// `setActivePinia(createPinia())` runs in every `beforeEach`, and forks
// are independent processes that cannot pollute each other.
//
// We therefore pin the fork pool to a conservative cap. 50 % of the
// available cores leaves headroom for the dev server, the language
// server, and the rest of the user's session, while still running the
// 49 spec files in roughly the same wall-clock time as the unbounded
// default (the test phase itself is < 8 s — most time is jsdom import).
//
// Override locally with `--maxWorkers=N` if a different trade-off is
// needed for a one-off run.
